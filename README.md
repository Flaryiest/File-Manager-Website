# File-Manager-Website

## About
Hello! This is a file manager web application built using node and postgresql.
The file manager has a simple drive page where you can upload files.
You can also create folders to store your files in.
If you would like to run the repo locally, configure a .env file with your db url, run prisma migrate dev --name init, run npm install, and then run node index.js
